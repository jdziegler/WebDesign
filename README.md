Below I am just passing around ideas.

Lets use PHP, MySQL, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

Expected Features:
1. Username and Password Registration and Login.
2. Some sort of Form + Post (like a Facebook post)
3. A page to display these posts. Allow edit/delete.
4. Possibly friend relationships, or more YikYak style.

Here are some references to build the (advanced) features of the project.

Querying the PHP Backend from Javascript: http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_database.asp
